#li3_git

A Lithium plugin that treats Git repositories as a datasource using [php-git2](https://github.com/libgit2/php-git).

##git as a datasource? umad bro?

Why not? Lightweight, fast, and has powerful versioning straight out of the box.
Sounds like the ideal candidate for a Content Repository.

##Usage
Install php-git2 and it's dependencies as described in the [readme](https://github.com/libgit2/php-git) - don't forget to run the tests!

li3_git itself doesn't do very much yet beyond connecting to a repository. Take
a look at the unit test for an example.
